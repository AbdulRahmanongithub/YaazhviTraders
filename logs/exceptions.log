# Exception Log File

This file is for logging exceptions in the YaazhviTraders React application.

For production deployment on Vercel, exceptions will be logged to the browser console and can be viewed in the Vercel dashboard under Runtime Logs.

Local development: Errors are logged to the browser console. To log to file, you can run the development server and redirect output, but typically, use browser dev tools.

Unhandled errors and React component errors are caught and logged via ErrorBoundary and global error handler.
